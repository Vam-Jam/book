# Dedicated Server
Brickadia allows you to host a server on a dedicated machine. You may want to do this if:
- You have a VPS/bare metal server spare
- You want to avoid hosting a server on your own machine/home network
- You want to offload the processing required onto another machine

## Requirements
Before you start this guide, you will need the following:
1. A machine that is running `Windows` or `Linux`
  - For the best reliability, we recommend getting a VPS or a bare metal machine from a server rental company. If you are home hosting off an old laptop, your results may vary.
2. A way to connect to that machine, either through `SSH` or with a keyboard & monitor.

### Linux Inital Setup
This section covers how to add a new linux user, as we advise you do not host off a root user. You can skip this if you know what you are doing.
